# NOMAD Documentation

<!-- A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and memorably -->
NOMAD is a free, and open-source data management platform for materials science, whose goal is to make scientific research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).

<!-- A paragraph of one to three short sentences, that describe what the product does. -->
NOMAD provides tools for data management, sharing, and publishing.
The platform lets you structure, explore, and analyze your data and the data of others.

<!-- A third paragraph of similar length, this time explaining what need the product meets -->
NOMAD solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and unfindable data.
<!-- Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for. -->
NOMAD is useful for scientists that work with data, for research groups that need to collaborate on data, and for communities that need to build an archive of FAIR research data.
