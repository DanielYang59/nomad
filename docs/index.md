# NOMAD Documentation

<!-- A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and memorably -->
NOMAD is a free open-source data management platform for materials science, based on FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles.

<!-- A paragraph of one to three short sentences, that describe what the product does. -->
NOMAD enables scientists and researchers to manage, share, and publish data.
The platform lets you structure, explore, and analyze your data and the data of others.
NOMAD promotes data-centered collaboration through an integrated and extendable set of tools.

<!-- A third paragraph of similar length, this time explaining what need the product meets -->
NOMAD solves the problem of not being able to use data that you can't find or that is too
heterogenous to be use effectively.

<!-- Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for. -->
NOMAD is useful for scientists that work with data, for research groups that need to collaborate on data, and for communities that need to build an archive of FAIR research data.

### Tutorial

This series of [short videos will guide you through the main functionality of NOMAD](tutorial.md).
It covers th whole publish, explore, analyze cycle:

- Upload and publish your own data
- Use the search interface to identify interesting data
- Use the API to search and access processed data for analysis

### How to guides

The documentation provides step-by-step instructions for a wide range of tasks. For example:

- [How to upload and publish data](data/upload.md)
- [How to write a custom ELN](schemas/elns.md)
- [How to run a parser locally](apis/local_parsers.md)
- [How to install NOMAD Oasis](oasis/install.md)

<h2>Project and community</h2>

NOMAD is an open source project that warmly welcomes community projects, contributions, suggestions, fixes and constructive feedback.
NOMAD is developed by FAIRmat, an open NFDI consortium of over 30 partners building a shared
data structure of for materials science together.
