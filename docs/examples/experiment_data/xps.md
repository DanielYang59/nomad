## Contextualization for the technique and the scientific domain
A variety of file formats are used in the research field of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and related techniques. The pynxtools-xps plugin of the pynxtools parsing library solves the challenge of how these formats can be parsed and normalized into a common representation that increases interoperability and adds semantic expressiveness.

pynxtools-xps, which is a plugin for [pynxtools](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools), provides a tool for reading data from various propietary and open data formats from technology partners and the wider XPS community and standardizing it such that it is compliant with the [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) application definition [`NXmpes`](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html) 

## Supported file formats
A list of the supported file formats can be found in the [pynxtools-xps](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/pynxtools-xps/) documentation.
