## Custom normalizers

For custom schemas, you might want to add custom normalizers. All files are parsed
and normalized when they are uploaded or changed. The NOMAD metainfo Python interface
allows you to add functions that are called when your data is normalized.

Here is an example:

```python
--8<-- "examples/archive/custom_schema.py"
```

To add a `normalize` function, your section has to inherit from `ArchiveSection` which
provides the base for this functionality. Now you can overwrite the `normalize` function
and add you own behavior. Make sure to call the `super` implementation properly to
support schemas with multiple inheritance.

If we parse an archive like this:

```yaml
--8<-- "examples/archive/custom_data.archive.yaml"
```

we will get a final normalized archive that contains our data like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "m_def": "examples.archive.custom_schema.SampleDatabase",
    "samples": [
      {
        "added_date": "2022-06-18T00:00:00+00:00",
        "formula": "NaCl",
        "sample_id": "2022-06-18 00:00:00+00:00--NaCl"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
