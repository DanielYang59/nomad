  theory:

    title: Electronic structure code input and output files
    description: |
      This upload demonstrate the basic use of NOMAD's *parsers*. For many *electronic
      structure codes* (VASP, etc.), NOMAD provides parsers. You simply upload
      the *input and output files* of your simulations and NOMAD parsers are extracting
      all necessary metadata to produce a **FAIR** dataset.
  eln:
    path: examples/data/uploads/eln.zip
    title: Electronic Lab Notebook
    description: |
      This example contains a custom NOMAD *schema* to create an **Electronic
      Lab Notebook (ELN)** and a few example *data* entries that use this schema.
      The schema demonstrates the basic concepts behind a NOMAD ELN and can be a good
      **starting point** to create you own schemas that model **FAIR data** acquired in your lab.
  tables:
    path: examples/data/uploads/tabular.zip
    title: Tabular Data
    description: |
      This upload demonstrates the used of tabular data. In this example we use an *xlsx*
      file in combination with a custom schema. The schema describes what the columns
      in the excel file mean and NOMAD can parse everything accordingly to
      produce a **FAIR** dataset.

  ellips:
    path: examples/data/uploads/ellips.zip
    title: Ellipsometry
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize ellipsometry data.
      It shows the generation of a NeXus file according to the [NXellipsometry](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXellipsometry.html#nxellipsometry)
      application definition and a successive analysis of a SiO2 on Si Psi/Delta measurement.
  mpes:
    path: examples/data/uploads/mpes.zip
    title: Mpes
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize multi photoemission spectroscopy (MPES) experimental data. It contains three major examples:

        - Taking a pre-binned file, here stored in a h5 file, and converting it into the standardized MPES NeXus format.
          There exists a [NeXus application definition for MPES](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html#nxmpes) which details the internal structure of such a file.
        - Binning of raw data (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00769-8) for additional resources) into a h5 file and consecutively generating a NeXus file from it.
        - An analysis example using data in the NeXus format and employing the [pyARPES](https://github.com/chstan/arpes) analysis tool to reproduce the main findings of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07158.pdf).
  xps:
    path: examples/data/uploads/xps.zip
    title: XPS
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize XPS data.
      It shows the generation of a NeXus file according to the
      [NXmpes](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html#nxmpes)
      application definition and a successive analysis of an example data set.
  sts:
    path: examples/data/uploads/sts.zip
    title: STS
    description: |
      AT this moment, the reader works for two types of experiments Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) from Scanning Probe Microscopy.
      It can only transform the data from Nanonis machine generate files into standarized nexus application definition NXsts. In this zip file, the data file are collected from
      two specific software versions generic 5e and genric 4.5.
  apm:
    path: examples/data/uploads/apm.zip
    title: Electronic Lab Notebook for Atom Probe Microscopy (APM)
    description: |
      This is an example for atom probe microscopy.
      The example contains a custom NOMAD *schema* to create an **Electronic
      Lab Notebook (ELN)** with which users can enter metadata that are usually
      not stored in vendor or community file formats. The example serves two
      purposes. On the one hand it shows how custom NOMAD *schema* can be
      created for a research community, here atom probe. On the other hand it
      shows how all required data in a NeXus NXapm file can be added to supplement
      content from vendor and community files.
  em_spctrscpy:
    path: examples/data/uploads/em_spctrscpy.zip
    title: Electronic Lab Notebook for Electron Microscopy (EM)
    description: |
      This is an example for electron microscopy.
      Specifically for spectroscopy methods in the SEM and TEM, exemplified
      for energy-dispersive X-ray (EDXS/EDS) spectroscopy and
      electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
      The example contains a custom NOMAD *schema* to create an **Electronic
      Lab Notebook (ELN)** with which users can enter metadata that are usually
      not stored in vendor or community file formats. The example serves two
      purposes. On the one hand it shows how custom NOMAD *schema* can be
      created for a research community, here electron microscopy. On the other hand
      it shows how required data in a NeXus NXem file can be added to supplement
      content from vendor and community files.
  iv_temp:
    path: examples/data/uploads/iv_temp.zip
    title: Sensor Scan - IV Temperature Curve
    description: |
      This example shows users how to take data from a Python framework and map it out to a Nexus application definition for IV Temperature measurements, [NXiv_temp](https://fairmat-experimental.github.io/nexus-fairmat-proposal/1c3806dba40111f36a16d0205cc39a5b7d52ca2e/classes/contributed_definitions/NXiv_temp.html#nxiv-temp).
      We use the Nexus ELN features of Nomad to generate a Nexus file.
